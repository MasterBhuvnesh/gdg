## What is a README File?
A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.

When you create a repository or a project, GitHub gives you the option of a default readme. The default readme file contains the repository name and some basic instructions. The file format is ‘md’, which stands for Markdown documentation. It is a lightweight markup language that can be easily converted to text. For more about Markdown component, Click Here.

## What is Markdown(.md file)?
Markdown can be converted into other formats (such as HTML) and has been incorporated into many things. It’s the standard format for ReadMe files in Git.

John Gruber of Daring Fireball (daringfireball.net) created Markdown. He says “Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web.”

### Why is a README File Necessary?

- **GitHub as an Open-Source Hub**  
  GitHub is the primary platform for sharing open-source projects, making it essential to provide proper documentation.

- **Clarifies Project Usage**  
  A README file explains the purpose of the project and how to install or use it, ensuring that others can understand and utilize it effectively.

- **Includes Visual Aids**  
  It allows adding images and videos, making it easier for users to navigate through the project.

- **Enhances Resume Value**  
  - If you showcase your project in a resume, a well-written README helps interviewers understand its purpose, the technologies used, and how it functions.  
  - This improves the impression your project makes during an interview.

- **Aids in Future Maintenance**  
  - Helps developers (including your future self) recall project details after a long time.  
  - Useful in debugging issues when revisiting an old project.  
  - If a bug arises months later, the README serves as a guide to understanding and fixing the code efficiently.
  
## Creating a profile README
Create a repository that is the same name as your username. In my case, Ashutosh.

1. Create a new repository with the same name (including casing) as your GitHub username: https://github.com/new

2. Create a README.md file inside the new repo with content (text, GIFs, images, emojis, etc.)

3. Commit your fancy new README!

4. If you’re on GitHub’s web interface you can choose to commit directly to the repo’s main branch (i.e., master or main) which will make it immediately visible on your profile)

5. Push changes to GitHub (if you made changes locally i.e., on your computer and not github.com)
